## Slack

We have a **#porter** channel in the [CNCF Slack][slack]. You can [request an
invite][invite] to join.

üó£ This is a good place to chat with other people about using Porter, developing
Porter mixins.

üêû This is not a good place to submit bug reports. Please [open an issue][issue]
instead so that we don't miss it!

There is also a **#cnab** channel that is very active where people discuss the CNAB
spec, and work on upstream libraries such as cnab-go and docker-to-oci.

## Office Hours

We meet the first of every month at 11am Central Time. Please join us and ask
questions, share how your bundles are going, just üëã and say _Hi_. 

If there isn't a lot going on, we will find something fun to do, for example
live code creating a new mixin. Feel free to leave a note on the agenda for our
next meeting if there's something that you would like to cover!
