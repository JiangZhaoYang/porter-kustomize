# Mixins

We have a number of [mixins](/mixins) to help you get started. The stable ones
are installed by default:

* exec
* kubernetes
* helm
* azure
* terraform

You can update an existing mixin, or install a new mixin using the `porter mixin
install` command:

```console
$ porter mixin install terraform
installed terraform mixin
v0.3.0-beta.1 (0d24b85)
```

All of the DeisLabs mixins are published to `https://cdn.deislabs.io/porter/atom.xml`.
