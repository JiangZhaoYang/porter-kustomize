    *A Friendly Cloud Installer for Cloud Native Application Bundles*
    
    When we deploy to the cloud, most of us arenâ€™t dealing with just a single cloud provider or toolchain. The simplest
    of applications today need a load balancer, SSL certificate, persistent file storage, DNS, and somewhere in there
    is your application. One app is installed with Helm, another with the cloud providerâ€™s cli and it is all glued
    together with magic bash scripts.
    
    That is a lot to figure out! ðŸ˜…  
    
    Porter is a cloud installer based on the Cloud Native Application Bundle (CNAB) spec that helps you manage
    everything together in a single bundle, focusing on what you know best: your application.
    

Porter ships with a number of builtin plugins known as `mixins` that facilitate
deployments of CNAB bundles.

!!! info
    You should read and undertsand the documentation on the [Porter.sh](https://porter.sh/) website and
    [GitHub repo](https://github.com/deislabs/porter) along with the [CNAB Website](https://cnab.io/)
    and [CNAB reference documentation](https://github.com/deislabs/cnab-spec) to fully understand the necessary
    concepts.

    *Kubernetes Native Configuration Management*
    
    Kustomize introduces a template-free way to customize application configuration that simplifies the use of
    off-the-shelf applications.

### So to what is `porter-kustomize`?

The `porter-kustomize` mixin helps extend [`porter.sh`]((https://porter.sh/)) in order to support 
[kustomize.io](https://kustomize.io/) which provides Kubernetes Native Configuration Management from porter.
